## HackerBot (Hackerone Statistics)

## Description

Check your information, see the status of your reports, view reported bugs from hackerone programs, and much more with [HackerBot](http://t.me/Hackerone_Statistics_bot).

## How to use it?

It's very simple, first you must enter your hackerone username and token as follows:

```
/config elliot_alderson DGfWa3p5AvGfbssuQyHvhxRmEE6N7l0Te4DLIanLdKf=
```

Once this is done, the only thing left is for you to embark on your journey with the bot.

There are two frequently used commands, these are:
```
/reports and /programs
```

For example, if you want to see how a specific report is doing, just provide the **report ID** to the command like this:
```
/reports unique 1250305
```
If you want to see the errors reported in a specific program **(AT&T in our example)**, you must provide the **name of the program** like this:
```
/programs weak_unique att
```
If you want to know how the other commands work, just go into [HackerBot](http://t.me/Hackerone_Statistics_bot) on telegram and use the **/help** command.
